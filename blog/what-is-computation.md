title: What is computation?
---
Here is a piece of code:



4 + 5;



This piece of code computes the sum of 4 and 5. The symbol \`+\` is the representation of this computation and ‘sum’ is its name which quite frankly sums it up really well!



Now here is the same computation in human readable format:



4+5



Yes that semicolon at the end was not dictated by some punctuation rule. Honestly does anyone really know where a semicolon goes??



I could carve this computation on a tree trunk in a park and anyone who sees it would be burdened by carrying it out for me and telling themselves that the result is 9.Trust me this burden would be nothing compared to the misery they would be exposed to if instead I were to draw a heart with my name on one side and the name of my platonic darling on the other side. How could anyone know what that heart,stuck in between two names, should do? Trust me \`+\` is a much merrier sign of union than a heart. Can you imagine seeing 4+5 carved on a tree and finding yourself wondering if 4 is really into 5 or whether 5 should really just move on with its life.No my friend you would just sum them up and move on!



But let us take it slow and think through how you would do this calculation.Unfortunately however unless you were five years old there is no slow way of doing this computation.Sun rises from the east, Donald Trump was elected as president and 5+4 my friend whether you like it or not equals nine.You just don’t think about it!In a flash of light you produce nine from your memory a technique which in computer programming is called memoization.



But assume you were five years old and were just learning how to add numbers. You would first translate 4 to your four fingers in one hand and 5 to all fingers on the other hand, in computer speak, you would be compiling the numbers to finger code (computers use bytecode) and lastly you would be counting all the fingers you picked one by one, which in programming, called an algorithm and woila! Yes you got it darling!
